Problem 2:- Find Missing and Repeated Number

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.

 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].

Answer:- 
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingAndRepeatedValues(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int missing = -1, repeat = -1;

        // Store frequency of each number in the grid
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            for (int num : row) {
                freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        // Check numbers from 1 to n^2 to find missing and repeated values
        for (int num = 1; num <= n * n; num++) {
            if (!freq.containsKey(num)) {
                missing = num;
            } else if (freq.get(num) == 2) {
                repeat = num;
            }
        }

        return new int[]{repeat, missing};
    }
}
